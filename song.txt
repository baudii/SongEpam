Tell me that I'm special, tell me I look pretty
Tell me I'm a little angel, sweetheart of your city
Say what I'm dying to hear
'Cause I'm dying to hear you

Tell me I'm that new thing, tell me that I'm relevant
Tell me that I got a big heart, then back it up with evidence
I need it and I don't know why
This late at night

Isn't it lonely?
I'd do anything to make you want me
I'd give it all up if you told me that I'd be
The number one girl in your eyes
